# Jira Cloud Approval Panel (Forge App)

This project is a Forge app for Jira Cloud that provides an **approval panel** inside the issue view.  
It introduces an **Approve** button, conditional visibility logic, and approval tracking (x/y approvers).

## üìå Features of approve_button_jira_cloud

- **Inline Lozenge Display**
  - Shows current **status** with a lozenge (green when Done, blue when In Review, etc.)
  - Shows all **approvers** as lozenges on a single line.

- **Conditional Approve Button**
  - Appears only when:
    - The issue is in **In Review** status.
    - The **Approvers** field is populated.
    - The **current user** is one of the approvers.

- **Approval Workflow Transition**
  - On click, performs a Jira workflow transition from (`In Review`) -> (`Approved`) and updates the **Approval Date** Jira field on refresh.

- **Approval Tracking (x/y)**
  - Uses an **issue property** (`approvalVotes`) to track which approvers have clicked approve.
  - Displays progress as **x/y approvers**.
  - Limitations: Have to add another logic check to ensure the transition to Approved is only possible when 100% of approvers have approved.

- **Auto-Refresh**
  - Listens to `JIRA_ISSUE_CHANGED` events so the panel refreshes when the issue updates.
  - Limitation: Only refreshes the Jira issue panel. Have not found the functionality to refresh the right hand side that shows the transition.

## üñ•Ô∏è User Experience

### Issue View with In Progress Status

### Workflow Validation Test
Not able to properly transition from `In Progress` to `In Review` because there is an assigned workflow validation check that ensures that at least one approver is assigned

## üöÄ How It Works (Step-by-Step)

1. **Panel Loads**
   - Fetches current user, status, approvers, and prior approval votes.
2. **Conditional Logic**
   - Determines if Approve button should show.
3. **On Approve Click**
   - Workflow transition ‚Üí ‚ÄúApproved‚Äù
   - Updates Approval Date field
   - Writes approver ID into issue property
   - Refreshes panel UI
4. **Display**
   - Status and Approvers inline as lozenges
   - Success message with **x/y approvals**


## ‚úÖ Next Steps

- Map status names to consistent lozenge colors (e.g., In Progress = blue, In Review = yellow).  
- Transition to approved only when 100% of approvers have approved.
- (Jira limitation) You can‚Äôt programmatically refresh the whole issue view
- Optionally show *who* approved (names with lozenges) instead of only counts.  
- Add Jira automation rule to notify admins when all approvers have approved.  (not necessary to use forge here)
